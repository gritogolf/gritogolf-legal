        <p>Welcome to Grito Golf. By downloading, installing, or using the Grito Golf app, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>Description of Service</h2>

        <h2>Account</h2>
        <p>You must sign in using Apple Sign In to use Grito Golf. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. You must be at least 13 years old to use the service.</p>

        <h2>Credits and Purchases</h2>
        <p>Swing analyses require credits. New users receive a free credit. Additional credits can be purchased through in-app purchases via the Apple App Store. All purchases are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>Credits are non-transferable and have no cash value. Credits do not expire. All purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or Apple's refund policies.</p>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use Grito Golf only for its intended purpose of golf swing analysis. You agree not to upload content that is illegal, harmful, or unrelated to golf swing analysis. You agree not to attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or interfere with the app or its servers. You agree not to use the service to harass, abuse, or harm others.</p>

        <h2>AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Grito Golf uses artificial intelligence to analyze your swing. While we strive for accuracy, AI analysis is not a substitute for professional golf instruction. The analysis, scores, drills, and suggestions provided are for informational and entertainment purposes only.</p>
        <p>We make no guarantees that following the advice will improve your golf game. We are not responsible for any injuries that may result from performing suggested drills or modifying your swing based on the analysis. Always consult a qualified golf professional or physician if you have concerns about your swing mechanics or physical ability.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of the swing videos you upload. By uploading content, you grant Grito Golf a limited license to process and analyze your videos for the purpose of providing the service. We will not sell, share, or publicly display your videos.</p>
        <p>The Grito Golf app, brand, design, and all analysis content generated by our system are owned by Grito Golf. You may share your analysis results (e.g., share cards) for personal use.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Grito Golf is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Grito Golf shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or physical injury, arising from your use of the service.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
