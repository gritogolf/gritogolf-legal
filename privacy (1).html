        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

        <p>Grito Golf ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Grito Golf mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple user ID and, if you choose to share them, your name and email address. Apple may provide a private relay email address instead of your real email.</p>
        <p><strong>Swing Videos:</strong> When you upload or record a golf swing video for analysis, the video is uploaded to our secure servers. Videos are used solely to generate your swing analysis and are not shared with third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>Launch Monitor Data:</strong> If you optionally upload a launch monitor screenshot, that image is uploaded to our servers and used only to enhance your swing analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis Data:</strong> The results of your swing analysis (scores, fixes, drills, etc.) are stored in our database and associated with your account so you can access your swing history.</p>
        <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> When you buy credits, Apple processes the payment. We receive a transaction ID to record that credits were added to your account. We do not receive or store your payment card details.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to provide and improve the Grito Golf service, including generating AI-powered swing analyses, maintaining your swing history, managing your credit balance, and improving the quality of our analysis.</p>

        <h2>AI Analysis</h2>
        <p>Your swing videos are analyzed using third-party AI services (Anthropic Claude). Frames from your video are sent to the AI model to generate your analysis. These frames are not stored by the AI provider after processing and are not used to train AI models.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure (Supabase, AWS, Railway). We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transmission. Videos are stored in Amazon S3 with restricted access.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your account data and swing history are retained for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting us at the email below.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate Grito Golf:</p>
        <p>Apple Sign In (authentication), Anthropic Claude (AI analysis), Amazon Web Services (video storage), Supabase (database), and Railway (server hosting). Each of these services has their own privacy policies governing their handling of data.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Grito Golf is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting us. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data, swing videos, and analysis history from our systems.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy in the app or on this page.</p>
